# Emrah UZUCAR | System Architect & Resonator Researcher
"Eksik Kavrayış = Eksik Fizik"

As a researcher focusing on Resonator Science (Kavrayan Bilim) and Non-Linear Route Optimization, I bridge the gap between cosmological scales and physical mobility. My work moves beyond "Interrupter" methodologies to align with the causal horizon of the universe (l=c⋅t).

🚀 Key Projects & Research

🛰️ The Derzz Protocol

A revolutionary navigation logic that treats the atmosphere not as a resistive medium, but as a resonant carrier.

Impact: Achieved a 96.7% reduction in fuel mass requirements for long-range trajectories in simulated Google Cloud Shell environments.

Logic: Utilizing the n(n+1)/2 discrete acceleration series to find the "Derzz" (interstitial gaps) in space-time.

🛸 Fazz-4 Control Logic

Real-time "Grasping" interface for high-performance aviation. It synchronizes thermal entropy (EGT) and Gaia sensors into a unified efficiency vector.

📜 The Chain (Zincir)

A framework for transitioning from Philosophical Necessity to Physical Models. This is the blueprint for the "Oracle Logic" that renders traditional ballistic interception algorithms obsolete.
